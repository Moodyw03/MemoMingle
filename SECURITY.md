# Security Guide for My Cloud Diary

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the My Cloud Diary application, including recent vulnerability fixes and best practices for maintaining security.

## Recent Security Updates

### Dependency Vulnerabilities Fixed

The following security vulnerabilities have been addressed:

#### Critical

- **python-jose algorithm confusion with OpenSSH ECDSA keys**
  - Resolution: Replaced python-jose with PyJWT, a more secure and better-maintained library for JWT handling

#### High

- **Werkzeug debugger vulnerable to remote execution**
  - Resolution: Updated to Werkzeug 3.0.2 which fixes this vulnerability
  - Additional protection: Ensured debug mode is disabled in production

#### Moderate

- **Jinja2 sandbox breakout vulnerabilities**
  - Resolution: Updated to Jinja2 3.1.3 which includes security patches for these issues
- **Werkzeug safe_join not safe on Windows**
  - Resolution: Updated to Werkzeug 3.0.2 which addresses this vulnerability
- **Werkzeug resource exhaustion when parsing file data**
  - Resolution: Updated to Werkzeug 3.0.2 which includes protection against this issue

## Security Headers

We've implemented the following security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities:

1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Restricts which resources can be loaded, preventing XSS attacks
2. **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
3. **X-XSS-Protection**: Provides XSS filtering in supported browsers
4. **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking by controlling iframe usage
5. **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)**: Enforces HTTPS connections
6. **Referrer-Policy**: Controls what information is sent in the Referer header

## Best Practices for Flask Security

### Authentication and Sessions

1. **Session Security**:

   - Use Flask's session management with a strong secret key
   - Never expose sensitive information in the session cookie
   - Set appropriate session timeouts

2. **Password Security**:
   - Always hash passwords using Werkzeug's security functions
   - Never store plaintext passwords
   - Consider implementing password complexity requirements

### Input Validation

1. **Form Data Validation**:

   - Validate all user inputs on both client and server sides
   - Use input sanitization to prevent SQL injection and XSS

2. **File Upload Security**:
   - Validate file types and sizes
   - Store uploaded files outside the web root
   - Generate random filenames

### CSRF Protection

1. **Implement CSRF Tokens**:
   - Add CSRF protection for all POST, PUT, and DELETE requests
   - Consider using Flask-WTF for built-in CSRF protection

### Production Deployment

1. **Environment Configuration**:

   - Never enable debug mode in production
   - Use environment-specific configuration files
   - Store secrets in environment variables, not in code

2. **Server Hardening**:
   - Use a production WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn, uWSGI)
   - Deploy behind a reverse proxy (Nginx, Apache)
   - Keep dependencies updated

### Regular Security Audits

1. **Dependency Scanning**:

   - Regularly run security audits (GitHub's Dependabot, OWASP Dependency Check)
   - Subscribe to security mailing lists for used packages

2. **Code Reviews**:
   - Conduct security-focused code reviews
   - Consider automated static code analysis tools
